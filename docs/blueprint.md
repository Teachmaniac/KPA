# **App Name**: KPA API Connector

## Core Features:

- Add Form API: Implement the 'Add Form' API from the provided Postman collection to allow submitting form data to the PostgreSQL database.
- Get Forms API: Implement the 'Get Forms' API to retrieve form data from the PostgreSQL database based on the phone number of the user. Return the data in JSON format as specified in the API documentation.
- FE Notifications: Implement user-friendly error messages to notify the user on the FE when certain fields fail the data integrity check in the BE.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to reflect professionalism and trust associated with data management.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that ensures readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: A subtle, darker shade of blue (#336699), analogous to the primary color, for interactive elements to maintain visual coherence but offer sufficient contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear and modern readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Icons) for clarity and easy recognition.
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear section headings and consistent spacing to improve data processing workflows.
- Subtle transition animations for form submissions and data loading to provide user feedback without being intrusive.
